                            and the pragmatic considerations that shape the language.
                            Keywords and phrases: Computational model, computation, program, programming language, syntax, semantics, pragmatics,
                            bound, free, scope, environment, block.<br>

                        <h2>OR We Can Define Programming Language's as</h2>
                        <p> languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. 
                            Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers 
                            can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.”
                            Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, 
                            has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
                            <br>
                            These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.
                            For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them
                            in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
                            <br>
                            There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important, 
                            relevant and in-demand of these languages below.</p>

                            <h2>How do computers understand programming languages?</h2>
                            <h3>The computer cannot understand the programs or language the way a human does.</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    When we type a Javascript program into the computer, it gets stored somewhere inside
                                     the case (in RAM or our Hard Drive) in a binary electrical format.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Some cool editor software is able to understand this electrical format and will continue to show on our screen a Javascript program.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When we execute this program of ours, the binary electrical representation of this Javascript program gets reduced 
                                    further into a different series of binary electrical circuits AKA machine language that the hardware can understand and work with
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Just to be clear, we might still think this machine language refers to the series of 1010101010 characters that we see on the screen. That is not what the machine understands. 
                                    The 1010101010 characters we see on the screen is again merely a reflection of the electrical switches underneath it all.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The CPU (a series of electrical hardware components) is built to take in each line of binary electrical signals (ML instructions)
                                     and modify its electrical state accordingly.
                                </li>

                                    hat we then see on our screen as a result of that program execution is again merely a reflection of this new electrical hardware state

                                     BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, including using curly braces to 
                                     delimit code blocks. BCPL was first implemented by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967

                                Time Magazine has stated that knowing a computer programming language can be good for you, and that it is a shame more people don’t have this knowledge.
                                 Even former President Obama has issued a video urging young people to take up programming, as “learning these skills isn’t just important for your future, it’s important for our country’s future”.
                                <br>
                                By starting with BASIC, you can create a framework for yourself to learn additional languages like C, C++, and Java. If you are currently working as an independent contractor, you will be able to maintain your flexible schedule with more time for your personal interests. And, as a highly demanded specialization, there is ongoing need for coders and programmers across almost every industry and a huge variety of business applications.</li>

                                The two professors who developed BASIC programming believed that computer literacy would be an essential skill in the upcoming years, and designed the language to be as accessible and understandable as possible. BASIC has dramatically influenced the computer science field, raising the need for coding knowledge in pretty much every area of our modern lives.

                                Computer scientists are known as an internationally diverse group. In the UK alone, research shows that around 20,000 computer scientists working in the country come from overseas. By entering a coding or programming course, you will be introduced to different cultures and even finish university with an international network of contacts.
                                <br>
                                Programming is an international language, with various computer codes being implemented around the world in relation to a variety of applications and companies. Check for opportunities that interest you outside of your home country. A semester or a year abroad will provide you with unique insight into how technology is used around the world, a chance to be exposed to differing cultures and to learn new languages.

                                The demand for computer programming knowledge is growing. Recent graduates in the computer science field earn, on average, pretty significant starting salaries. Compared to social science and humanities majors, for instance, computer science majors earn a 71% higher starting salary. NACE (The National Association of Colleges and Employers) reported some of the highest starting salaries earned by graduates of bachelor degree programs:
                                <br>

                                    <li>Information security analysts – $55,100</li>
                                </ul>
                                If you are an independent contractor, you can benefit from a flexible schedule and a comfortable work environment. Many programmers choose to work with individuals on a project-by-project basis in order to earn extra cash during their free time. Even if you are still learning basic programming, try to start getting some hands-on experience while you have the time and energy!
